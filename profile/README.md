# Web Dev 1 · Learn the Web

Web development is the production of functional, interactive websites 
accomplished through the use of the HTML and CSS coding languages. Using
 video tutorials, step-by-step online lessons, and automation, students 
explore processes such as semantics and mobile-first architecture, and 
tools like cloud platforms and version control, in tandem with precise 
organization principles and current best practices.

## Learn the Web

**Learning code doesn’t have to be confounding.**

There are too many topics and too many tutorials online. It’s hard to figure 
you which are up-to-date and even harder to figure out what order to 
follow them.

Learn the Web, is a structured, curated, living guide to web development for graphic 
designers—presenting the information in a logical, targeted order that 
goes from a basic mobile-friendly webpage to a complex multi-screen 
interactive website.

## Thomas J Bradley

I believe that everybody should perpetually learn, try, build, break, 
& fix things—the Open Web is the perfect platform for exactly that.
